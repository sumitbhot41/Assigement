    "Here are the answers to your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique used for variable selection and regularization. It differs from other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares regression and Ridge Regression, in that it adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector, effectively performing variable selection by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically select a subset of relevant features while shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This helps improve model interpretability and generalization by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. However, due to the penalty term, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding feature is not contributing to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, denoted as lambda (Î»). This parameter controls the strength of the penalty term and determines the trade-off between fitting the training data and reducing the complexity of the model. Higher values of lambda result in more shrinkage of the coefficients and greater sparsity in the coefficient vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is primarily designed for linear regression problems. However, it can be used for non-linear regression problems by first transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space using techniques such as polynomial features or kernel methods. Once the data is transformed, Lasso Regression can be applied to the transformed features in the higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the penalty term used to regularize the model. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso Regression adds a penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. As a result, Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero without necessarily setting them exactly to zero, whereas Lasso Regression can lead to exact zero coefficients, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent. Because it performs variable selection by setting some coefficients to zero, it can effectively deal with multicollinearity by automatically selecting a subset of relevant features and discarding redundant ones. However, it may still be affected by severe multicollinearity, particularly when the correlation between features is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen using techniques such as cross-validation. A range of lambda values is tried, and the one that gives the best performance on a validation set (e.g., minimizing mean squared error) is selected. Alternatively, techniques such as grid search or randomized search can be used to efficiently search for the optimal lambda value."
