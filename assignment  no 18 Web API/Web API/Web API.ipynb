    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of API usage in real life is when you use a weather application on your smartphone. The weather application likely retrieves weather data from a remote server using an API provided by a weather service provider, such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com. The application sends a request to the weather service API with parameters like location and date, and the API responds with the requested weather data, which the application then displays to the user."
