    "**Assignment: Bagging in Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?**\n",
    "- Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple trees on different bootstrap samples of the training data. Each tree captures different patterns in the data due to the randomness introduced by bootstrapping, leading to reduced variance in the ensemble model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging?**\n",
    "- *Advantages*: Using different types of base learners in bagging can increase the diversity of the ensemble, leading to improved generalization and robustness. For example, combining decision trees with different depths or using a combination of decision trees and neural networks can capture different aspects of the underlying data.\n",
    "- *Disadvantages*: However, using highly complex base learners can increase computational complexity and training time. Additionally, if the base learners are too similar, it may not provide significant improvements in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How does the choice of base learner affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging?**\n",
    "- The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging by influencing the tradeoff between bias and variance of the ensemble model. For example, using decision trees as base learners can lead to low bias but high variance, while using linear models may result in higher bias but lower variance. By combining multiple base learners with different biases and variances, bagging aims to reduce the overall variance of the ensemble while maintaining low bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Can bagging be used for both classification and regression tasks? How does it differ in each case?**\n",
    "- Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, bagging involves aggregating the predictions of multiple classifiers (e.g., decision trees) to make a final prediction, typically using majority voting. In regression, bagging involves aggregating the predictions of multiple regression models (e.g., decision trees) to make a final prediction, typically using averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the role of ensemble size in bagging? How many models should be included in the ensemble?**\n",
    "- The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners included in the ensemble. The optimal ensemble size depends on various factors such as the complexity of the problem, the diversity of the base learners, and computational resources. Increasing the ensemble size can lead to better performance up to a certain point, after which the improvement may plateau or even decrease due to overfitting or increased computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of bagging in machine learning?**\n",
    "- One example of a real-world application of bagging is in financial forecasting, where multiple predictive models (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) are trained on historical financial data to predict stock prices or market trends. By aggregating the predictions of these models using bagging, analysts can obtain more accurate and robust forecasts, reducing the risk of relying on a single model.\n",
