    "Q1. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts in linear algebra closely related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues**: Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent how a linear transformation (represented by a square matrix) stretches or compresses a vector. They are denoted by Î» (lambda). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors**: Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that are only scaled (stretched or compressed) by a linear transformation, represented by a square matrix. They retain their direction after the transformation, although their magnitude may change. \n",

    "In the Eigen-Decomposition approach, a square matrix \\( A \\) is decomposed into a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues: \\( A = Q \\Lambda Q^{-1} \\), where \\( Q \\) is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of \\( A \\), and \\( \\Lambda \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \\( A \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The eigenvalues (\\( \\lambda \\)) and eigenvectors (\\( \\mathbf{v} \\)) of \\( A \\) can be found by solving the equation \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v} \\). Solving this equation yields eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_1 = 4 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\) with corresponding eigenvectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), respectively.\n",

    "Q2. Eigen decomposition is the process of decomposing a square matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is significant in linear algebra because it provides a way to understand and analyze the behavior of linear transformations represented by matrices. Eigen decomposition allows us to represent certain types of transformations, such as scaling and rotation, in a simpler form, making it easier to analyze and manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. For a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "- The matrix must be square.\n",
    "- The matrix must have \\( n \\) linearly independent eigenvectors, where \\( n \\) is the dimension of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: A square matrix \\( A \\) is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix \\( Q \\) such that \\( A = Q \\Lambda Q^{-1} \\), where \\( \\Lambda \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \\( A \\). If \\( A \\) has \\( n \\) linearly independent eigenvectors, then the columns of \\( Q \\) can be formed from these eigenvectors, and \\( Q \\) is invertible. Therefore, \\( A \\) is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The spectral theorem states that for a symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. In the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach, the spectral theorem ensures that the matrix can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues, simplifying the decomposition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the symmetric matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Using eigen decomposition, we find eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_1 = 3 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 1 \\) with corresponding eigenvectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), respectively. These eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0 \\), where \\( A \\) is the matrix, \\( \\lambda \\) is the eigenvalue, and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. Eigenvalues represent how a linear transformation stretches or compresses vectors in a given direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that are only scaled by a linear transformation represented by a matrix. They are related to eigenvalues through the equation \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v} \\), where \\( A \\) is the matrix, \\( \\lambda \\) is the eigenvalue, and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Geometrically, eigenvectors represent directions in space that are not altered in direction by a linear transformation but may be scaled (stretched or compressed) by a corresponding eigenvalue. Eigenvalues represent the amount of stretching or compression along the eigenvector directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Some real-world applications of eigen decomposition include image compression, signal processing, quantum mechanics, structural analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) in data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. However, these eigenvectors and eigenvalues are not unique and may vary depending on the matrix. For example, a matrix with repeated eigenvalues may have multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. The Eigen-Decomposition approach is useful in data analysis and machine learning for various purposes:\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA rely on eigen decomposition to find principal components.\n",
    "- Eigen decomposition can be used for feature extraction, noise reduction, and data compression.\n",
    "- It helps in understanding the structure and behavior of data by decomposing it into simpler components.\n",
    "- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide insights into the properties and transformations of matrices, which are essential in various machine learning algorithms."
