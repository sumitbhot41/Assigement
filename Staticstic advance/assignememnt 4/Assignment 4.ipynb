    "# Q1: Difference between t-test and z-test\n",
    "# T-test is used when sample size is small or population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "# Z-test is used when sample size is large and population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example scenario:\n",
    "# T-test: Comparing the mean exam scores of two different groups of students, each group having less than 30 students.\n",
    "# Z-test: Comparing the mean exam scores of two different groups of students, each group having more than 30 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests\n",
    "# One-tailed test checks for the possibility of the relationship in one direction only.\n",
    "# Two-tailed test checks for the possibility of the relationship in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors\n",
    "# Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true.\n",
    "# Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is accepted when it is actually false.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example scenario:\n",
    "# Type 1 error: Rejecting the null hypothesis that a drug has no side effects when it actually does.\n",
    "# Type 2 error: Accepting the null hypothesis that a drug has no side effects when it actually does have side effects.\n",

    "# Q4: Explanation of Bayes's theorem\n",
    "# Bayes's theorem calculates the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of related conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "# Where:\n",
    "# P(A|B) = Probability of event A occurring given B has occurred\n",

    "# Q5: Confidence interval\n",
    "# A confidence interval is a range of values in which we are confident that the population parameter lies within.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# If the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight loss from a diet is (10, 15) pounds,\n",
    "# it means we are 95% confident that the true mean weight loss is between 10 and 15 pounds.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Solution:\n",

    "# 95% Confidence Interval = (Mean - Margin of error, Mean + Margin of error)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8: Margin of error in a confidence interval\n",
    "# Margin of error is the range above and below the sample statistic within which the population parameter is likely to lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# With a larger sample size, the margin of error decreases, leading to a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9: Calculation of z-score\n",
    "# Z-score = (X - μ) / σ\n",
