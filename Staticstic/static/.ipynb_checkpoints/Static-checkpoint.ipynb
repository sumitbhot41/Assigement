    "Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves methods for gathering data, summarizing it, and drawing conclusions or making predictions based on the data. Statistics is widely used in various fields such as science, economics, social sciences, business, and many others to make informed decisions and understand patterns or trends in data."

    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They include measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. For example, descriptive statistics might be used to summarize the heights of students in a classroom by calculating the average height, the most common height, and the spread of heights.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involve making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. These techniques include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. For instance, inferential statistics might be used to determine whether there is a significant difference in test scores between two groups of students and to generalize those findings to the larger population."
