    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method in feature selection evaluates the relevance of features independently of the model. It assesses the characteristics of individual features, such as their correlation with the target variable or their statistical significance, to determine their importance. Common techniques in the Filter method include correlation analysis, chi-square test, ANOVA, and mutual information."

    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the Filter method, which evaluates features independently of the model, the Wrapper method assesses subsets of features based on the performance of a specific machine learning algorithm. It uses a search strategy (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination) to iteratively select subsets of features and evaluates their performance using cross-validation or a separate validation set."

    "3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection into the model training process itself. Common techniques include:\n",
    "Lasso (L1 regularization): Penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients, forcing some coefficients to become zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Ridge (L2 regularization): Penalizes the squared size of the coefficients, which can also shrink coefficients towards zero, although not as aggressively as Lasso.\n",
    "Decision tree-based methods: Such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machines, which inherently perform feature selection by selecting the most informative features at each split."

    "4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of the Filter method is that it evaluates features independently, without considering the interactions between them or their combined predictive power.\n",
    "It may not be effective in situations where feature dependencies are important for model performance.\n",
    "Additionally, the Filter method may not always select the most relevant features for a specific predictive model, as it does not consider the model's performance directly."

    "5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is generally preferred when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or when computational resources are limited, as it is computationally less expensive compared to the Wrapper method.\n",
    "It can also be useful as a preliminary step for feature selection to quickly identify potentially relevant features before applying more computationally intensive methods like the Wrapper method."

You are unsure of which features to include in the model because the dataset contains several different ones. Describe how you would choose the most pertinent attributes for the model using the Filter Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, I would start by calculating the correlation between each feature and the target variable (customer churn). Features with high absolute correlation coefficients would be considered more relevant.\n",
    "Additionally, I could perform univariate statistical tests such as ANOVA or chi-square tests to assess the significance of each feature in predicting churn.\n",
