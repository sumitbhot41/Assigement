    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of the underlying patterns. Consequences include poor generalization to unseen data, high variance, and potential poor performance on real-world data. To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and using more data can be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. Consequences include high bias and poor performance on both training and test data. To mitigate underfitting, one can try using a more complex model, adding more features, or reducing regularization."

    "Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between a model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data (bias) and its sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data (variance). High bias models are too simple and may underfit the data, while high variance models are too complex and may overfit the data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for achieving good model performance."
