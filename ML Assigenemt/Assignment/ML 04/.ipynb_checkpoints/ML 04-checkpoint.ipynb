    "\n",
    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical variables into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is useful in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, and encoding categorical variables allows us to use these algorithms effectively."

    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with categories {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}, we can encode them as {\"red\": 0, \"green\": 1, \"blue\": 2}.\n",

For example, when encoding categorical variables like \"color\" or \"vehicle type,\" where there is no inherent order among the categories."
