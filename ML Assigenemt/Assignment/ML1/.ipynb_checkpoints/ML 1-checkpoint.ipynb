    "It seems like you're asking several questions related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Let's address each question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. Differentiate between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task, ML algorithms use data to learn patterns and relationships, allowing them to improve their performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence the term \"deep\") to learn complex representations of data. DL algorithms have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Science (DS)**: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and statistical knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data. It encompasses various techniques, including data mining, machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, to analyze and interpret complex datasets."
